===== WritHelper =====
Version: 1.0.0

An ESO addon that shows what must be crafted to complete a set of writs

Installation:
Be sure that the addon is installed in
C:\Users\username\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\AddOns\
in a folder name 'WritHelper'.
If the downloaded file is named 'WritHelper-master':
Delete the '-master' and you're all set.

Usage:
Once loaded, pick up your crafting writs and head to a crafting station.
The items that you must craft at that station to complete the writ will be
displayed on your screen. You can move the display around to anywhere you
want, and that position will be saved. Be default it will be in the top left.
Once you have completed crafting and turn in the quests, all the crafting
information will be deleted and nothing will be displayed in the crafting
screen until the next set of writs you pick up.
